# About Me

## 🏗️ My Past Life
For some time, I served as Sanitary Works Manager and Supervision Inspector. I administered sanitary engineering projects, ensuring the efficient implementation of every aspect, from planning to execution. Imagine me as the conductor of a heating symphony, ensuring precise heat flow through pipes and installations. I wanted each element to work harmoniously with each other so that users could enjoy effective heating. 🌡️🏢🔥

## 🌟 Why the Change?
After the birth of my child, I realized that I no longer belonged to the construction world. So I decided to turn to technology. I replaced my helmet with a laptop! Initially, I was involved in manual testing, but it was SQL, with its irresistible charm, that completely drew me into the world of data!

## 🛠️ My Superpowers
**SQL Magic**: I am very knowledgeable in using SQL queries, from the simplest to the most complex, and I enjoy analyzing data.  
**Data Analysis Ace**: I have the ability to extract key information from data and use it to make decisions or propose solutions.  
**Passionate about Continuous Development**: I am constantly developing my skills, and SQL courses and books are my favorite guides on this path.  
**Technology Explorer**: I am always ready to explore new possibilities in the area of ​​database management, database structure design, and data analysis. This is my passion, and I strive to improve in these areas to expand my skills and realize my full potential in the field of data.

## 🚀 Where Am I Going?
I am passionate about the mission of discovering the potential of data! I plan to implement several projects that will pose unique challenges for me in the area of ​​databases - from design, through construction, to effective database management. Additionally, I want to use data analysis to answer questions that have been bothering me recently (e.g. do solar flares affect the Earth's climate?).  
As part of one of the projects, I would like to create a dedicated application for my beautician. This application will be used by regular customers to order cosmetics for collection, providing them with the convenience and flexibility of not having to pay for their order at the time of ordering. Currently, I am focusing on designing this application and building a proper database to improve my skills.

## 📚 **My Passions**
Outside the world of SQL, my life is filled with various passions that inspire me and give me constant joy of creating:

- **World of Literature**: Books are a source of inspiration and knowledge for me, which I use in my everyday work and life. I read a lot - from technical literature, through psychology, to fantasy, which allows me to look at problems from different perspectives.
- **Craft and Design**: I create my own world of things, often collaborating with my husband, but equally willing to act on my own. I am proud of my projects, such as a comfortable bed for my daughter or a mobile chest of drawers for craft tools. When I'm not working on professional projects, you can find me in my studio, where I am passionate about knitting, sewing, and embroidery.

## 📬 Let's Unite!
I'm eager to connect with other professionals and discover new opportunities in the world of data. Connect with me on LinkedIn and let's see how we can work together.
